I utilized ChatGPT to discover third-party APIs, and among them, I found the Joke Fetcher API.

I utilized ChatGPT to use the Material Icons library by including the following link in the index.html file of my React project: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" />. This allowed me to use Material Icons for update and delete functionalities in my inventory management application.
